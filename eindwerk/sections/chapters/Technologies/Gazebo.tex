Gazebo, an open-source \acs{3d} robotics simulator, makes it possible for developers to rapidly test algorithms, design robots, 
perform regression testing, 
and train \acs{ai} systems using realistic scenarios. In gazebo the developer can create custom environments. 
These environments have realistic rendering including high-quality lighting, shadows, and textures. 
Sensors that can see the simulated environment on robots can be modeled \cite{gazebo:org}.
