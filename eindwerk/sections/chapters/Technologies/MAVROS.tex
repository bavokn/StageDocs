Mavros is a MAVLink extendable communication node for \acs{ros} with a proxy for \acs{gcs} (\acl{gcs}). A ground control station 
is a land- or sea-based control center that provides the ability to control unmanned vehicles.
This is the crucial link between MAVLink and \acs{ros}. It is a \acs{ros} “node” that can convert between \acs{ros} topics and
MAVLink messages allowing ArduPilot vehicles to communicate with \acs{ros} \cite{mavros:wiki}. Next to providing communication 
between \acs{ros} and the ArduPilot vehicles MAVROS also contains a multitude of builtin methods to simplify coding when handling
basic actions of a vehicle. MAVROS provides, for example, methods to arm and take off with a \acs{uav}.
