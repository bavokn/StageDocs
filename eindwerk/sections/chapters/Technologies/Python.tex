Python is an indentation language emphasizing code readability with notable use of whitespaces. 
The standard library is very comprehensive. Object-oriented and structured programming are both fully supported. 
Python has not all functionality in its core, it is rather built to be highly extensible \cite{python:wiki}.

As a dynamically typed language, Python is very flexible. There are no hard limitations or rules 
on how to build an application or solution to a problem. Encountering errors python still compiles 
and runs your program until it hits the problematic part.
