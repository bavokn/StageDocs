The last container, the controller, is responsible for starting the multi-agent system. Each \acs{uav} 
will run as a parallel process in the simulation. 
To start a \acs{uav}, a specific pattern of commands has to be followed. Before starting a connection, 
a heartbeat must be made with each \acs{uav} 
that must be maintained throughout its flight. When a connection is lost, that specific \acs{uav} will 
stop its current action and land on its home point.

When a connection is established, a developer is able to arm the \acs{uav}. It is possible to visually 
confirm that a \acs{uav} is armed when its rotors are spinning. 
After arming a home point has to be set; this is a safe place where the \acs{uav} can land in case of 
connection loss. When a \acs{uav} is armed and has a 
home point, it is ready for further instructions. These agents fly autonomously. For a \acs{uav} to fly without 
user input it has to be put into the “OFFBOARD” mode. 
Finally, when a \acs{uav} is in this mode it can be added to a team, coalition, or hologenic hierarchy. 
Depending on the hierarchy a \acs{uav} will take on an action 
and help to try and solve the given problem.
