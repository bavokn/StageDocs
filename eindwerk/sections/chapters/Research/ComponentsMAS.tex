A multi-system does not have a lot of necessary core components to be able to work. First
of all the system does need to have multiple intelligent agents. These agents need to be
able to ”see” their environment with sensors. These sensors can vary depending on the
system.

The data from the sensors from each agent, the knowledge each agent has, needs to be
sharable with the other intelligent agents. Using this knowledge the system must distribute
the computational load over the agents, No agent is designated as controlling.
