A multi-system does not have a lot of necessary core components to be able to work.
First of all the system does need to have multiple intelligent agents. These agent need to be able to 
"see" their invironment with sensors. These sensors can very depending on the system.

The data from the sensors from each agent, the knowledge each agent has,
needs to be sharable with the other intelligent agents. Using this knowledge the system must distribute 
the computational load over the agents, No agent is designated as controlling.
