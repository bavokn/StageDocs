\subsubsubsection{Experiments}

In this project a lot of different small components work together to form
a bigger system. To test each different component small experiments were tested on a 
smaller scale. Each experiment was run in a smaller system to isolate problems. By isolating a component
it is easier to write generic code for further use.

This provides more insight on each component and how they work. If experiments turn out positive 
they are implemented in the bigger system.

\subsubsubsection{Observing other projects}

A lot of components allready have been coded in other projects in different ways. Observing
other projects gave a lot of insight on how to tackle a problem or on how to evaluate an experiment.
