When handling a large problem multi-agent systems provide a robust and scalable solution. 
By spreading the computational workload the system is not only fast but also very reliable.

When an agent fails in a multi-agent system the system will have the availability to 
recover fairly easily from this due to the robustness. 
Control and responsibilities are shared over all the agents. 
The system can tolerate failures of one or more agents by adding the failed actions 
that were being performed by these agents back into the blackboard system. 
Other agents can then try and complete these actions again.

Another advantage of a multi-agent system is scalability. 
Adding another agent to a multi-agent system is easier than expanding an already existing application. 
In a multi-agent system, all the agents are identical therefore introducing a new agent will only update the internal hierarchy.
