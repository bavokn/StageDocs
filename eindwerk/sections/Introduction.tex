A new technical era has arrived with current development in \acs{uav} technologies with it becoming available to the public. 
The \acsp{uav} of today are capable of accomplishing tremendous complex tasks on their own. But what if the potential of 
multiple \acsp{uav} are combined in a multi-agent system? 
How will these \acsp{uav} cooperate and how can this be implemented? To define the capabilities of a multi agent-system 
multiple scenarios are tested with multiple \acsp{uav}. 

In this thesis, an example of a multi-agent system will be explored to familiarize the reader with the concepts of agents,
multi-agent systems, and the cooperation of agents in these systems. First, the technologies will be explained to help the reader comprehend the concepts.
In the example a multi-agent system is set up where between 5 and 10 \acsp{uav} can cooperate as intelligent agents, communicating through a blackboard communication system. 
Each agent can decide its actions autonomously. The entire system is run inside docker containers with the ability to visualize the environment in Gazebo, 
a 3D dynamic simulator with the ability to accurately and efficiently simulate populations of robots in complex indoor and outdoor environments.
