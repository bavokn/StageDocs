These twelve weeks of internship were challenging. There were a lot of struggles along the way.
I always had good colleagues and a promotor/mentor who I could rely on.
They helped me tremendously throughout the course of this internship. There were a lot of ups 
and downs but the result is here.

By writing this part of the thesis, it not only concludes the paper, but also my internship and my time at the PXL. I would 
like to show gratitude to the PXL/PXL-smartict for allowing me to take part in conducting research and giving me an 
opportunity to show my abilities. The project pushed my boundaries out of my comfort zone and helped me learn in ways 
I couldn't even imagine.

I would like to show gratitude to my colleagues and my promotor; Vic Segers, Borcherd van Brakell and Tim Dupont.
